# ENSF 608 - Databases
### Assignment 2

The objective of this assignment is to apply understanding of the relational data model and the process of mapping from conceptual ER/EER diagrams to a logical design.

The assignment consists of two main tasks:

Mapping an EER Diagram to a Relational Data Model: The first task involves mapping an EER diagram, representing a university database, into a relational data model. This includes defining all primary keys and referential integrity constraints (foreign keys).

Reverse Engineering a Relational Schema to an ER Model: The second task involves reverse engineering a given relational schema, representing a library database, to create a conceptual ER model. Any assumptions made during this process need to be clearly stated.

This assignment is intended to enhance understanding of the relationship between ER/EER diagrams and relational data models, and the process of transitioning between these different levels of abstraction.
